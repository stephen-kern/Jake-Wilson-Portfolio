## Description

The portfolio has recently undergone a revamp and has been updated to utilize the latest technologies. The original version, developed in April 2022, was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The updated version, however, has been developed using JavaScript and React, integrating a variety of node packages to enhance its functionality and performance. These packages include Material UI (MUI), React-Modal-Image, EmailJS, Dotenv, and GH-Pages.

- **MUI**: provides components such as ImageList and MobileNav
- **React-Modal-Image**: used for the image modal that pops up upon image click
- **EmailJS**: handles the back-end data transfer for the contact form
- **Dotenv**: used to protect sensitive data
- **GH-Pages**: to deploy the application to GitHub

## Motivation

With the aim of refining my understanding of React and practicing the fundamentals, I took on the task of revising my first meaningful project. This not only provided me with a valuable learning experience, but it also allowed me to support my friend Jake in sharing his innovative creations with others. The project served as a platform for both personal and professional growth.

## Lessons Learned

- Use the `*` selector in css to select all the children of an element
- Include `useRef()` when you need to persist some value across re-renders, but don't want to trigger a re-render when it changes
- NEVER force push to main... 

---
## Room for Improvement

- Try to add more comments during code creation
- Try writing some unit tests for the components
- Continue to learn about responsive images for optimal image display on various screen sizes
